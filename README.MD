This is a webpage for a Salt Cave https://oazahb.cz, which provides a unique and relaxing experience for visitors. The
webpage was originally created in 2017 as my first PHP commercial project. Since then, I have gained more experience and
knowledge in web development, and I am now refactoring the webpage to improve its code quality and functionality.
